Hello there. I am the Miranda Notifier. To use me: you need to agree to the following:
1. Do not use commands to breach the server rules or the Terms of Service for the platform in which you wish to use it in.
2. Using multiple accounts is permitted with restrictions (unless your main account was disabled for breaching the TOS).
3. Currency and tradeable goods from the Miranda System cannot be used for anything outside of it.

React with :white_check_mark: to agree.
